## About me
I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I am a member of the [Programming Languages & Software Engineering Group (PLSE)](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering), advised by [Professor Qirun Zhang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~qzhang414/). My research interests are broadly in the area of programming languages, and I'm specifically interested in static analysis and program verification techniques, including using SMT solvers like [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). I'm also excited to apply ideas from theory and mathematics to program analysis. I graduated from Grinnell College in 2021 with distinction in Computer Science and Mathematics.
