## About me
I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I am a member of the [Programming Languages & Software Engineering Group (PLSE)](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering), advised by [Professor Qirun Zhang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~qzhang414/). My research interests are broadly in the area of programming languages, and I'm specifically interested in static analysis and program verification techniques. I'm also excited to apply ideas from theory and mathematics to program analysis.
