## About me
Besides computer science, I'm interested in aviation, public transport, and geography. I spend most of my free time walking and/or hiking, listening to podcasts, and traveling. Recently, I've been on a mission to find out how many streets with names containing "Peachtree" there are in metro Atlanta.

I became interested in computer science in part by participating in [FTC Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) during high school. I still sometimes volunteer with [Team 535 Tobor](https://www.sites.google.com/site/535tobor) in Crawfordsville, IN, USA.

During my time as an undergraduate, I worked as a reporter and editor at the Grinnell College student newspaper, [The S&B](http://www.thesandb.com/). I also wrote some articles for the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/) during summer 2018.
